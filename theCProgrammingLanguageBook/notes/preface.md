##Written by: Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie
##Personal notes written by DBTow

#Preface

-First edition published in 1978
-C has origins as the language of the UNIX operating system

-As C grew more popular groups started to create their own compilers thus their was a need for a formal definition of the language
-1983 the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) created the ANSI standard for C

-This book follows the ANSI standard for C and describes C in that manner


#Preface to the first edition
C = general-purpose programming language

C is not high level nor is it a "big" language
-The language's absence of restrictions and generality make it a powerful language

This book aims to help the reader learn how to program in C
-However this book is not an introductory programming manual (assumes some familiarity with basic programming concepts)
