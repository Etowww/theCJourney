-Initialized this progress log

-Initialized a .gitignore
    -To ensure no executables or other undesired filetypes are in the repository it uses a whitelisting strategy.
    -Begins by ignoring every filetype *
    
    -Then uses the ! pattern to create exceptions for the following filetypes:
        - .c / .h / .md / .gitignore

        -may need further additions in the future but we will try it out for the time being
